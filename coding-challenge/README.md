# Coding challenge

## Setting up the project

Make sure you have node.js installed with either npm (default) or yarn.

## Design Decisions

The code uses React 16.7. As such, it is no longer required to use an import statement for importing react.
In an ideal situation, pagination would be implemented but i was unable to see how to implement it with the api provided.
All the data is loaded and then only the first three posts/comments are displayed.

## Test coverage

The project is 90% test covered. The only files that aren't tested are `App.tsx` and `index.tsx` as they're the entry points.
